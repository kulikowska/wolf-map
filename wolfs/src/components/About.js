            <h1> A Short History of the Reintroduction</h1>
            The gray wolf was purposefully shot, trapped, and poisoned in Yellowstone National Park since the park&apos;s establishment
            in 1872, until the wolf&apos;s complete extirpation in the mid 1930s. In the absence of one its major predators, the Yellowstone ecosystem 
            began to decline. With the overpopulation of large game animals, chiefly elk and deer, much of the vegetation in the park
            became drastically overgrazed, leading to the decline in populations of many trees, birds, fish, and small game.
            <br /><br />

            Officially endangered since 1967, wildlife biologists had been calling for a restoration of wolves into the northern 
            rockies since the 60s, and with the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973, the US Fish and Wildlife Service 
            was obligated to develop a plan. The year before saw the first official meeting to discuss the reintroduction into Yellowstone 
            specifically, and in 1980 a plan was approved. The objective for the program was to restore a consistent population of at 
            least 10 packs that have produced pups for 3 consecutive years, at which point the gray wolf would be removed from the
            endangered species list of the northern rocky mountains.

            In January 1995, after 20 years of planning, fourteen wolves were captured in Hinston, Alberta, just east of Jasper
            National Park. Journeying 880km south to Yellowstone, they were then released into 3 acclimation pens, and after 10 weeks 
            released into the wild. The following year saw seventeen wolves from an area east of Willingston Lake, British Columbia (approx 1200km from Yellowstone)
            translocated into 4 acclimatation pens and later released. The wolves did exceptionally well, exceeding population growth expectations, even breeding in pens. All but one pack 
            remained in the park, with a 1995 total of 21 wolves, and with 3 litters born in 1996 boosting the population  to 51.
