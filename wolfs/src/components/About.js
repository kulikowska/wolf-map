            <h1> A Very Brief History of the Reintroduction</h1>

            By the mid 1930’s, the gray wolf population had been completely wiped out of Yellowstone National Park. The population had already been in 
            decline at the time of the park’s establishment in 1872, and without any legal protection for wildlife in the early years,
            the wolves were hunted, trapped and poisoned into extinction. In the absence of one of its apex predators, the Yellowstone ecosystem began 
            to decline. With the overpopulation of large game animals, primarily elk, much of the vegetation in the park became overgrazed, causing many
            tree, bird, fish, and small game populations to suffer, and a general imbalance in the park’s ecosystem.
            <br /><br />

            Wildlife biologists had been calling for a restoration of wolves in to the northern Rockies since the 60s, and with the passage of the Endangered 
            Species Act in 1973, the US Fish and Wildlife Service was obligated to develop a plan. The year before saw the first official meeting to discuss
            the reintroduction into Yellowstone specifically, and in 1980 a plan was approved. The objective for the program was to restore a consistent 
            population of at least 10 packs that have produced pups for 3 consecutive years.
            <br /><br />

            In January 1995, after 20 years of planning, fourteen wolves were captured in Hinston, Alberta, just east of Jasper National Park.
            Journeying 880km south to Yellowstone, they were then released into 3 acclimation pens, and after 10 weeks released into the wild.
            The following year saw seventeen wolves from an area east of Willingston Lake, British Columbia (approx 1200km from Yellowstone) translocated
            into 4 acclimatation pens and later released. The wolves did exceptionally well, exceeding population growth expectations. All but one 
            pack remained in the park, with a 1995 total of 21 wolves, and with 3 litters born in 1996 boosting the population to 51. For the next 
            3 years the population steadily rose, and the wolf population has remained stable.

            The Yellowstone Wolf Map was created by Canadian web developer and lifelong wolf admirer,  
            <a href="http://www.rubykulikowska.com" target="_blank">Ruby Kulikowska</a>. All data has been gathered from the 
            <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/wolfreports.htm" target="_blabk">Annual Wolf Project Reports.</a>
            The site is still in its early stages, so hang tight, there is lots to come in terms of both data and site features! If you’d like to get in touch, you can contact Ruby at

            <h1> A Short History of the Reintroduction</h1>
            The gray wolf was purposefully shot, trapped, and poisoned in Yellowstone National Park since the park&apos;s establishment
            in 1872, until the wolf&apos;s complete extirpation in the mid 1930s. In the absence of one its major predators, the Yellowstone ecosystem 
            began to decline. With the overpopulation of large game animals, chiefly elk and deer, much of the vegetation in the park
            became drastically overgrazed, leading to the decline in populations of many trees, birds, fish, and small game.

            Officially endangered since 1967, wildlife biologists had been calling for a restoration of wolves into the northern 
            rockies since the 60s, and with the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973, the US Fish and Wildlife Service 
            was obligated to develop a plan. The year before saw the first official meeting to discuss the reintroduction into Yellowstone 
            specifically, and in 1980 a plan was approved. The objective for the program was to restore a consistent population of at 
            least 10 packs that have produced pups for 3 consecutive years, at which point the gray wolf would be removed from the
            endangered species list of the northern rocky mountains.
